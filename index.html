            <h1>The Global Threat of a Nuclear War</h1>
            <p>The state of the world peace is at stake. With the ongoing <b>Russia and Ukraine war</b> and the <b> Israel and Hamas war</b> increases the tension of a Nuclear
                war emerging. The emergence of a nuclear weapon began in the 1945 when the USA bombed Japans' Hiroshima and Nagasaki.This caused a catastrophic lose of 
                lives and property. Tensions of a nuclear war increased afterwards with the USA and Russia cold war for the <b>armsrace</b>. The cold war era ended following
                the collapse of SOVIET UNION.

                <p class="text">Today their are countries who posses nuclear weapons due to the advancedment of technology and in the name of keeping their country safe. Over the 
                    years, the USA and the United Nations have been keeping the world peace and have been a watchdog to control countries from developing weapons of mass destruction.
                    But it seems it has gotten out of hand as countries nowadays can develop any weapon they want which violates the rules of worls peace and orde.
